Learnining how to link the front end to the back end
LETS DO THIS!!!

** Notes to observer

I broke this out into 3 sections. 
    clientDev
    serverDev
    production

clientDev is just the front end development
In that folder there exists a shell script buildServer.sh
buildServer.sh will transfer all the necessary files over to the serverDev space

serverDev is the backend development space, it includes the clientDev files necessary in /public

In the root directory there exists the shell script build.sh
build.sh builds both client and server spaces and puts all necessary files in /production

/production does not have express installed and is the only thing necessary to run the server.
It is assumed that express is installed globally on the computer in this directory. If not npm install 
it there in /production.

Thanks. 

Sorry for no style points. At least the functionality works though.
