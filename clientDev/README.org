* Setup for a very basic web dev environment
I made this to basically simplify getting a project started

Simply clone/fork this and put it in a directory

*Run*
npm install

Thats It

** Uses and configures the following
Webpack
Webpack-cli
Webpack-dev-server
Babel
React
React-DOM
React-Router-DOM

** Scripts available
*** npm start
Runs a server at specified port Default :8080
*** npm run build-watch
Starts webpack -w in development mode
*** npm run build
Builds everything for production

** Directories
*** src
A place for all your code
*** public
Where *index.html* and *styles.css* lives. Change these to your liking.
This is where the root of the page lives effectively. Using npm build will make
main.js here.

** If you have any problems let me know or submit an issue on github
*Hope you enjoy*
